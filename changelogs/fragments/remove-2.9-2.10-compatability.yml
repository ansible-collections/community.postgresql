major_changes:
  - The community.postgresql collection no longer supports ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. While we take no active measures to prevent usage and there are no plans to introduce incompatible code to the modules, we will stop testing against ``Ansible 2.9`` and ``ansible-base 2.10``. Both will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to the ``latest Ansible / ansible-core 2.11 or later`` as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/pull/245).
