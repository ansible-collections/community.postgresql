bugfixes:
  - postgres - psycopg2 automatically sets the datestyle on the connection to
    iso whenever it encounters a datestyle configuration it doesn't recognize,
    but psycopg3 does not. Fix now enforces iso datestyle when using psycopg3
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/issues/711).
