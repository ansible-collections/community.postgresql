minor_changes:
  - "postgresql_pg_hba - changes ordering of entries that are identical except for the ip-range, but only if the ranges are of the same size, this isn't breaking as ranges of equal size can't overlap (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/pull/772)"
  - "postgresql_pg_hba - orders auth-options alphabetically, this isn't breaking as the order of those options is not relevant to postgresql (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/pull/772)"
