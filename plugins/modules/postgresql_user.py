module: postgresql_user
short_description: Create, alter, or remove a user (role) from a PostgreSQL server instance
description:
- Creates, alters, or removes a user (role) from a PostgreSQL server instance
  ("cluster" in PostgreSQL terminology) and, optionally,
  grants the user access to an existing database or tables.
- A user is a role with login privilege.
- You cannot remove a user while it still has any privileges granted to it in any database.
- Set I(fail_on_user) to C(false) to make the module ignore failures when trying to remove a user.
  In this case, the module reports if changes happened as usual and separately reports
  whether the user has been removed or not.
options:
  name:
    description:
    - Name of the user (role) to add or remove.
    type: str
    required: true
    aliases:
    - user
  password:
    description:
    - Set the user's password, before 1.4 this was required.
    - Password can be passed unhashed or hashed (MD5-hashed).
    - An unhashed password is automatically hashed when saved into the
      database if I(encrypted) is set, otherwise it is saved in
      plain text format.
    - When passing an MD5-hashed password, you must generate it with the format
      C('str["md5"] + md5[ password + username ]'), resulting in a total of
      35 characters. An easy way to do this is
      C(echo "md5`echo -n 'verysecretpasswordJOE' | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'`").
    - Note that if the provided password string is already in MD5-hashed
      format, then it is used as-is, regardless of I(encrypted) option.
    type: str
  login_db:
    description:
    - Name of database to connect to and where user's permissions are granted.
    - The V(db) alias is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0.0.
    type: str
    default: ''
    aliases:
    - db
  fail_on_user:
    description:
    - If C(true), fails when the user (role) cannot be removed. Otherwise just log and continue.
    default: true
    type: bool
    aliases:
    - fail_on_role
  role_attr_flags:
    description:
    - "PostgreSQL user attributes string in the format: CREATEDB,CREATEROLE,SUPERUSER."
    - Note that '[NO]CREATEUSER' is deprecated.
    - To create a simple role for using it like a group, use C(NOLOGIN) flag.
    - See the full list of supported flags in documentation for your PostgreSQL version.
    type: str
    default: ''
  session_role:
    description:
    - Switch to session role after connecting.
    - The specified session role must be a role that the current login_user is a member of.
    - Permissions checking for SQL commands is carried out as though the session role
      were the one that had logged in originally.
    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - The user (role) state.
    type: str
    default: present
    choices: [ absent, present ]
  encrypted:
    description:
    - Whether the password is stored hashed in the database.
    - You can specify an unhashed password, and PostgreSQL ensures
      the stored password is hashed when I(encrypted=true) is set.
      If you specify a hashed password, the module uses it as-is,
      regardless of the setting of I(encrypted).
    - "Note: Postgresql 10 and newer does not support unhashed passwords."
    - Previous to Ansible 2.6, this was C(false) by default.
    default: true
    type: bool
  expires:
    description:
    - The date at which the user's password is to expire.
    - If set to C('infinity'), user's password never expires.
    - Note that this value must be a valid SQL date and time type.
    type: str
  no_password_changes:
    description:
    - If C(true), does not inspect the database for password changes.
      If the user already exists, skips all password related checks.
      Useful when C(pg_authid) is not accessible (such as in AWS RDS).
      Otherwise, makes password changes as necessary.
    default: false
    type: bool
  conn_limit:
    description:
    - Specifies the user (role) connection limit.
    type: int
  ssl_mode:
    description:
      - Determines how an SSL session is negotiated with the server.
      - See U(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-ssl.html) for more information on the modes.
      - Default of C(prefer) matches libpq default.
    type: str
    default: prefer
    choices: [ allow, disable, prefer, require, verify-ca, verify-full ]
  ca_cert:
    description:
      - Specifies the name of a file containing SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate(s).
      - If the file exists, verifies that the server's certificate is signed by one of these authorities.
    type: str
    aliases: [ ssl_rootcert ]
  comment:
    description:
    - Adds a comment on the user (equivalent to the C(COMMENT ON ROLE) statement).
    - To reset the comment, pass an empty string.
    type: str
    version_added: '0.2.0'
  trust_input:
    description:
    - If C(false), checks whether values of options I(name), I(password), I(expires),
      I(role_attr_flags), I(comment), I(session_role) are potentially dangerous.
    - It makes sense to use C(false) only when SQL injections through the options are possible.
    type: bool
    default: true
    version_added: '0.2.0'
  configuration:
    description:
      - Role-specific configuration parameters that would otherwise be set by C(ALTER ROLE user SET variable TO value;).
      - Takes a dict where the key is the name of the configuration parameter. If the key includes special characters
        like C(.) and C(-), it needs to be quoted to ensure the YAML is valid.
      - Sets or updates any parameter in the list that is not present or has the wrong value in the database.
      - Removes any parameter from the user that is not listed here.
      - Parameters that are present in the database but are not included in this list will only be reset, if
        O(reset_unspecified_configuration=true).
      - Inputs to O(user) as well as keys and values in this parameter are quoted by the module. If you require the
        user to contain a C("), you need to double it, otherwise the module will fail. C(") and C(') are not allowed in
        configuration keys and any C(') in the value of a configuration will be escaped by this module.
        Additionally, parameters and values are checked if O(trust_input) is C(false).
    type: dict
    default: {}
    version_added: '3.5.0'
  reset_unspecified_configuration:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), the user's default configuration parameters will be reset in case they are not included in
        O(configuration), otherwise existing parameters will not be modified if not included in O(configuration).
    type: bool
    default: false
    version_added: '3.5.0'
  quote_configuration_values:
    description:
      - Automatically quote the values of configuration variables added via I(configuration). The default is C(true)
        and setting this to C(false) leaves these options open to SQL-injections and makes the user responsible for
        properly quoting values.
      - This is required to be C(false) to modify settings like C(search_path), that need to be unquoted.
      - If this is C(false) you will also need to make sure that strings are properly quoted.
        For example C("'16MB'") for C(work_mem).
      - Set this only to C(false) if you know what you are doing!
    type: bool
    default: true
    version_added: '3.11.0'
notes:
- The module creates a user (role) with login privilege by default.
  Use C(NOLOGIN) I(role_attr_flags) to change this behaviour.
- If you specify C(PUBLIC) as the user (role), then the privilege changes apply to all users (roles).
  You may not specify password or role_attr_flags when the C(PUBLIC) user is specified.
- SCRAM-SHA-256-hashed passwords (SASL Authentication) require PostgreSQL version 10 or newer.
  On the previous versions the whole hashed string is used as a password.
- 'Working with SCRAM-SHA-256-hashed passwords, be sure you use the I(environment:) variable
  C(PGOPTIONS: "-c password_encryption=scram-sha-256") when it is not default
  for your PostgreSQL version (see the provided example).'
- On some systems (such as AWS RDS), C(pg_authid) is not accessible, thus, the module cannot compare
  the current and desired C(password). In this case, the module assumes that the passwords are
  different and changes it reporting that the state has been changed.
  To skip all password related checks for existing users, use I(no_password_changes=true).
- On some systems (such as AWS RDS), C(SUPERUSER) is unavailable. This means the C(SUPERUSER) and
  C(NOSUPERUSER) I(role_attr_flags) should not be specified to preserve idempotency and avoid
  InsufficientPrivilege errors.
